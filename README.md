Micro-Manager plugin to Z project images in live during Multi-Dimensional Acquisition (MDA).

During MDA with Z slices, ZProjector can be used to display a second window on which images are Z projected.

- Launch MM
- Select Plugins > On-The-Fly Processors > Configure Processors

Now you can start an MDA, a secondary window will display and show Z projected images.

Note that you can change projection type in plugin configuration window.
